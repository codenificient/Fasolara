# FasoLara Website 

The Next.JS based website for the FasoLara platform. First draft demo hosted on Vercel at https://fasolarafrontend.vercel.app/

The frontend page is connected to the original Express version of the server and is displaying temporary data which is on the database. Thousands of sample documents have been created for users, panels, projects and all the other major data models. Current frontend is showing users, villages and provinces.

Curently completed scaffolding the various pages and initial routing

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). 

This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
